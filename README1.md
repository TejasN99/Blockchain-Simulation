# Running the code

Run the python file "p2p_with_event_handler" along with 5 parameters:
1) z0: percentage of slow nodes in the network
2) z1: percentage of low CPU nodes in the network
3) Ttx= Average interarrival time between each transaction in ms
4) I= Interarrival time for Block in ms
5) n=Number of Nodes
6) Total_Txns= Simulation termination criteria

Sample Command: ./p2p_with_event_handler.py 40 40 4000 60000 10 500

# Output of Code
Suppose code was run with the following parameters:
z0=40, z1=40, Ttx=4000, I=60000, num_nodes=10, Total_Txns=500
At end of simulation, a folder is created whose name is in the following format:
Log_I_60000_ttx_4000_nodes_10_z0_40_z1_40_TXNS_500
This folder contains:
1) A log file for each node whose format is node_nodenum.txt where nodenum is the node number (e.g: node_1.txt, node_2.txt etc.) 
2) overall_stats.txt

# node_nodenum.txt contains:
1) Type of node: Slow/Fast, Low/High CPU
2) Every event associated with the node along with timestamp
3) The blockchain tree structure at the node when the simulation ended
4) First block is G (Genesis) followed by the block ids of its child blocks
5) If the blockchain has forks, there is one chain for each leaf block

# overall_stats.txt contains:
Simulation Paramters:
1) Numer of nodes
2) Avg Mining time
3) Avg. time between transactions
4) Percentage of slow nodes
5) Percentage of High CPU nodes

The Graph of the Network (Network Topology):
Each row of the graph has the node number followed by its peer nodes


Statistics like:
1) Number of blocks in the longest chain
2) Total number of blocks in blockchain
3) Avg. number of transactions per block
4) Percentage of blocks in the main chain generated by High CPU Nodes
5) Percentage of blocks in the main chain generated by Fast Nodes

Note: To calculate the above stats, the first node has of the network is used as the reference
